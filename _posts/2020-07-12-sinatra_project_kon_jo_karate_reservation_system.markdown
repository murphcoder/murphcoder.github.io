So for my Sinatra project, I thought I would design something practical. My father runs a karate school, and he has numerous after school classes which take place at elementary schools. His current system for reserving a class involves sending a flyer home with the parent, and they send back the insurance wavier and a check with their child. This system does not work very well, as the kids are constantly losing the paperwork, so I tried to design something where parents could sign up for classes online.

My app allows both parents and instructors to log in. Parents can sign their children up for classes, see a list of classes they are signed up for, and see how much they owe. Instructors can see what classes they are responsible for, see a list of their students, and if they have admin access, create new classes and locations. I was hoping to include the ability for parents to pay their bill and sign an insurance waiver in this version of the app, but once I looked into that further, I found that the services my father uses for both insurance waivers and payment processing would require me to know Javascript, so I will have to return to this project and add those features later once I have learned that language. Please email me if you have any further questions about my app. filmmakersean@fastmail.net
