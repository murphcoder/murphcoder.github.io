# I apologize for the lateness of this post. My day job has been extremely demanding as of late.

I've been finding myself fascinated by the YIELD method I've recently learned. I find the lessons where I rebuild WHILE and UNTIL loops to extremely interesting. It helps to show me that Ruby has nearly unlimited possibilities. I'm not just learning a programming language, I'm learning how to expand that programming language, how to design and add new methods and commands as I need them. It's not only fascinating, it's oddly fulfilling. I get a sense of accomplishment out of correctly writing a program that I wasn't expecting. It make me wish I was financially secure enough to do this boot camp full time! However, even though I can't do this full time, I'm thoroughly enjoying learning about the possibilities of Ruby, and looking forward to the day when this can become my profession.
