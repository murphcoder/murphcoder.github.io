My latest app is what I call an airport trip planner. It takes in a flight number, departure date, and street address from the user, and logs on to two separate APIs to determine the flight's arrival time, as well as the optimal directions for reaching the airport two hours before your flight's departure time. In addition, it has a user login system which interfaces with my Rails backend and saves your trips to my Rails API for future reference. Thank you for examining my app, and I look forward to discussing it with you!
