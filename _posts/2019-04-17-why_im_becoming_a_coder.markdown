So your website suggested I make this post about why I want to get into software development, and I'm assuming you want something more detailed than, "I want to make more money." :-)

I've always been very good with computers. We had a computer in my house at the age of five, and growing up with them help me to understand them, pretty intuitively. Originally, I went to school for filmmaking, but that's turned out to be a difficult field to make a living in. Coding seems like a good compromise between practical and creatively fulfilling. Since I've started doing this course, I find myself really enjoying solving the various problems in the lessons. It's not frustrating or tedious to me like I thought it would be, it feels very rewarding! While my main reason for getting into coding has been to earn more money, the more I do it, the more it feels engaging and fulfilling, which makes me think it could lead to a good career and a veey happy life.
