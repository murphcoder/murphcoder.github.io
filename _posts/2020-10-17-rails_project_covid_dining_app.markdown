During the pandemic, I have found myself frustrated by the number of local restaurants not following local health guidelines, so for my Rails project, I decided to design an app to address that situation. It is what I call a Covid Dining App. It functions similarly to Yelp and allows users to review local restaurants, but it has specific focus on whether or not the restaurants are following local regulations, and whether or not they have outdoor dining and carryout.
