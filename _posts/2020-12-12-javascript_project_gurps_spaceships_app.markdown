This app allows you to generate spaceship statistics for the roleplaying game GURPS. The game has a very detailed spaceship simulation system that is a lot of fun to use in play, but the actual designing of spaceships is rather tedious without a computer. Therefore, I designed an app that allows you to design spaceships for the game in a fraction of the time it would take you with pen and paper. The spaceships are calculated up in Javascript, and then uploaded and stored on a Rails backend. Please check it out, especially if you are a fan of GURPS!
