Metaprogramming seems absolutely fascinating. I've just now been introduced to it, and I find the concept to open up so many possibilities. Not only would metaprogramming allow you to write more efficient code, it would allow you to write sort of nested programs. Programs within programs that you can call back to whenever necessary. If I undwrstand the concept correctly, it would also allow you to take existing code from another program, modify it, and run that modified code. The possibilities here seem nearly limitless, espwcially for programming AI. I can see that a Tic Tac Toe program with AI is coming up in my lessons, and I suspect metaprogramming will be essential to that project. I wonder, would metaprogramming make it possible to modify code written in another programming language? Could one take a program written in a language other than Ruby and modify it with Ruby? I'll have to learn more. The possibilities seem essentially endless. I'm really enjoying learning this stuff!
